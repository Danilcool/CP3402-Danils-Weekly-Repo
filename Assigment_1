## Learning Journey For Assignment 1

In This assessment I delved into creating websites for a business that's yet to step into the real world. 
Content Management Systems Joomla and WordPress. The selection of Joomla and WordPress stems from a desire to gain comprehensive 
insights into distinct CMS systems, each renowned for its unique features and functionalities.
The decision to work with two different CMS systems is deliberate, aiming to broaden the understanding of various web development methodologies and enhance overall proficiency. 
It is anticipated that this dual-platform approach will not only provide a comprehensive skill set but also present a nuanced perspective on the strengths and weaknesses of each CMS.

### Learning Activities & Resources


Upon completing the Joomla website, it was time to shift gears to the WordPress counterpart. 
However, there are constraints within the assessment framework that demand careful consideration. Thus, a thorough investigation into WordPress became imperative

### Estimated Hours

I spent about two days on this assignment, and using WordPress for the first time took longer than expected. Breaking it down, I used around two hours for documentation, 
four hours for Joomla, and a solid 12 hours brainstorming how to make things better for users. It's not just about finishing the task; 
it's about investing time to improve the user experience. These hours aren't just numbers – they represent the effort put into creating better digital spaces.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights

As I build this website, it becomes evident that there's a lot more to grasp about different CMS systems. Although I can produce websites, 
they're not flawless yet. I've gained more hands-on experience with Joomla, especially due to the practical work I undertook last week. However, there's still a plethora of plugins and tools that I'm yet to explore.
