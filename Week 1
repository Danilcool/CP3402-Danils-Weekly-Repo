Learning Activities & Resources

This week, the beginning of the class was focused on relearning and revisiting the old code we learned in our HTML and CSS class. This was a great time to come back and revisit my project, done as a final project in my website class, and make the necessary changes after it was graded.

Resources I have used include HTML Wiki and CSS code readers to make it more understandable. I have also taken a course in HTML that emphasizes design and offers courses on CSS as well as an artistic approach to the creation of websites.

Estimated Hours

I would say the total time for learning the course and fixing up my website was broken down into different stages. Fixing the website took no longer than 2 hours, as it had a solid foundation. However, the course was a good 10 hours of lectures and practicals focused on teaching the user about stylish CSS design.

Content Insights

Website hosting is something that should be done with a paid structure to be able to experience a functional website. I have managed to extend my URL timeline as well as update my website based on changes made.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

It is hard to gauge if the skills learned this week will be useful, but I would say the theories of design are extremely applicable in my design.
