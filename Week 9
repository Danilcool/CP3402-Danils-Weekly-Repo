Content Insights
This week, we took the time to understand and refine our theory surrounding the development of our local host. 
As we initiated and completed the development of the website sketch, we quickly realized that we hadn't adhered to any guides or 
lessons from our past classes. Due to this limitation in creating the website, it lacked the professionalism inherent in the development process, hindering its overall advancement and foundation.

In response to this realization, we decided to invest more effort into this version, aiming to rectify our mistakes. 
We commenced with the development of the idea, design, and the goals behind the project – specifically, to attract new 
students to the JCU website. This led us to the creation of a detailed sketch on paper, outlining the design and goals, 
as well as a rough draft on the software for the UX elements of the website.

Thanks to these improvements, our website now boasts a much more professional appearance. It includes pictures, 
a header call to action, and a sleek, professional design, all guided by our pre-planned development approach. 
The final product of our international endeavor resulted in a well-balanced design, incorporating all the necessary elements seamlessly.

Career/Employability/Learning InsightsLearning the effective way to set up meetings, as well as communication 
Reflecting on our recent website development, we identified a crucial oversight – our failure to follow established guides and 
past learning experiences from classes. This lapse became evident in the project's early stages, resulting in a lack of professionalism 
and hindering overall progress. 

To rectify this, we invested additional time in refining our approach, focusing on the idea, design, and goals, 
especially in the context of attracting new students to the JCU website. The subsequent improvements, guided by pre-planned development, 
transformed the website into a more polished creation with enhanced features.

In terms of career and learning insights, this experience emphasized the importance of adhering to established best practices and learning 
from past mistakes. Effective communication, structured planning, and adaptability emerged as key factors in successful project development. 
Looking forward, this reflection guides us to incorporate these lessons into future endeavors, ensuring a more professional and successful outcome.
